# movie-recommendation-system
## **Context**


Online streaming platforms like **Netflix** have plenty of movies in their repository and if one can build a **Recommendation System** to recommend **relevant movies** to users, based on their **historical interactions**, this would **improve customer satisfaction** and hence, improve the revenue of the platform. The techniques used here will not only be limited to movies, and can be used for any recommendation system.

## **Objective**

In this project I built various recommendation systems: 
- Knowledge/Rank based recommendation system
- Similarity-Based Collaborative filtering
- Matrix Factorization Based Collaborative Filtering

This was achieved by using the **ratings** dataset.
